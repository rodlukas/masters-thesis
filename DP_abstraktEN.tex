The goal of this thesis is to extend the web application for the project ``Successful first-grader'' which offers an extra education and courses for preschoolers. The original application was created in a bachelor\textquotesingle s thesis and offers features for storing information about clients, their attendances, groups, payments for the lectures, and viewing the client\textquotesingle s entire history. The server side of the original and also the new application is written in Python with Django web framework, the client side is built with React and communicates via a REST API thanks to Django REST Framework. The final new extended application meets all the new requirements made by the lector. Also, thanks to the integration with advanced tools for easier development and maintenance, high code coverage by automated API and UI (E2E) tests, and configuration of multiple deploy environments, more reliable and faster delivery of new releases is possible. The application is deployed to more environments (including the production one) to Heroku and offers much more efficient and comfortable everyday work covering more areas of functionality thanks to the new features.
